Some results and notation that are used throughout the text are collected in this chapter for convenience. Students may wish to review this chapter quickly at first and then read each section more carefully again as the concepts appear in the course of the text.

\section{Basics}\label{section00001}
The basics of set theory: sets, $\cap$, $\cup$, $\in$, etc. should be familiar to the reader. Our notation for subsets of a given set $A$ will be
\[
B = \{a \in A | \cdots (\text{conditions on a}) \cdots\}.
\]
The order or cardinality of a set $A$ will be denoted by $|A|$. If $A$ is a finite set the order of $A$ is simply the number of elements of $A$.

It is important to understand how to test whether a particular $x \in A$ lies in a subset $B$ of $A$ (cf. Exercises 1 to 4). The Cartesian product of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the collection $A \times B = \{(a, b)| a \in A, b \in B\}$, of ordered pairs of elements from $A$ and $B$.

We shall use the following notation for some common sets of numbers:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] $\mathbb{Z}= \{0, \pm{1}, \pm{2}, \pm{3}\cdots\}$ denotes the integers (the $\mathbb{Z}$ is for the German word for numbers: "Zahlen").
\item[(2)] $\mathbb{Q} = \{a/b|a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, b \neq 0\}$ denotes the rational numbers (or rationals).
\item[(3)] $\real = \{\text{all decimal expansions }\pm{d_1d_2\cdots d_n.a_1a_2a_3\cdots}\}$ denotes the real numbers (or reals).
\item[(4)] $\mathbb{C} = \{a + bi|a, b \in \real, i^2 = -1\}$ denotes the complex numbers.
\item[(5)] $\mathbb{Z}^+$, $\mathbb{Q}^+$ and $\real^+$ will denote the positive (nonzero) elements in $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$ and $\real$, respectively.
\end{enumerate}

We shall use the notation $f: A \to B$ or $A \stackrel{f}{\rightarrow} B$ to denote a function $f$ from $a$ to $B$ and the value of $f$ at $a$ is denoted $f(a)$ (i.e. we shall apply our functions on the left). We use the words function and map interchangeably. The set $A$ is called the domain of $f$ and $B$ is called the codomain of $f$. The notation $f: a \mapsto b$ or $a \mapsto b$ if $f$ is understood indicates that $f(a)=b$, i.e. the function is being specified on elements.

If the function $f$ is not specified on elements it is important in general to check that $f$ is well defined, i.e. is unambiguously determined. For example, if the set $A$ is the union of two subsets $A_1$ and $A_2$ then one can try to specify a function from $A$ to the set $\{0, 1\}$ by declaring that $f$ is to map everything in $A_1$ to 0 and is to map everything in $A_2$ to 1. This unabiguously defines $f$ unless $A_1$ and $A_2$ have elements in common (in which case it is not clear whether these elements should map to 0 or to 1). Checking that this $f$ is well defined therefore amounts to checking that $A_1$ and $A_2$ have no intersection.

The set
\[
f(A) = \{b \in B | b = f(a), \text{for some } a \in A\}
\]
is a subset of $B$, called the range or image of $f$ (or the image of $A$ under $f$). For each subset $C$ of $B$ the set
\[
f^{-1}(C) = \{a \in A | f(a) \in C\}
\]
consisting of the elements of $A$ mapping into $C$ under $f$ is called the preimage or inverse image of $C$ under $f$. For each $b \in B$, the preimage of $\{b\}$ under $f$ is called the fiber of $f$ over $b$. Note that $f^{-1}$ is not in general a function and that the fibers of $f$ generally contain many elements since there may be many elements of $A$ mapping to the element $b$.

If $f:A \to B$ and $g: B \to C$, then the composite map $g \circ f: A \to C$ is defined by
\[
(g \circ f)(a) = g(f(a)).
\]

Let $f:A \to B$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] $f$ is injective or is an injection if whenever $a_1 \neq a_2$, then $f(a_1) \neq f(a_2)$.

\item[(2)] $f$ is surjective or is a surjection if for all $b \in B$ there is some $a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$, i.e. the image of $f$ is all of $B$. Note that since a function always maps onto its range (by definition) it is necessary to specify the codomain $B$ in order for the question of surjectivity to be meaningful.

\item[(3)] $f$ is bijective or is a bijection if it is both injective and surjective, If such a bijection $f$ exists from $A$ to $B$, we say $A$ and $B$ are in bijective correspondence.

\item[(4)] $f$ has a left inverse if there is a function $g:B \to A$ such that $g \circ f:A \to A$ is the identity map on $A$, i.e. $(g \circ f)(a)=a$, for all $a \in A$.

\item[(5)] $f$ has a right inverse if there is a function $h:B \to A$ such that $f \circ h:B \to B$ is the identity map on $B$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{proposition}{}{prop0000101}
Let $f:A \to B$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] The map $f$ is injective if and only if $f$ has a left inverse.
\item[(2)] The map $f$ is surjective if and only if $f$ has a right inverse.
\item[(3)] The map $f$ is bijective if and only if there exists $g:B \to A$ such that $f \circ g$ is the identity map on $B$ and $g \circ f$ is the identity map on $A$.
\item[(4)] If $A$ and $B$ are finite sets with the same number of elements (i.e. $|A|=|B|$). then $f:A \to B$ is bijective if and only if $f$ is injective if and only if $f$ is surjective.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Exercise.
\end{proof}

In the situation fo part (3) of the proposition above the map $g$ is necessarily unique and we shall say $g$ is the 2-sided iverse (or simply the inverse) of $f$.

A permutation of a set $A$ is simply a bijection from $A$ to itself.

If $A \subset B$ and $f: B \to C$, we denote the restriction of $f$ to $A$ by $f|_A$. When the domain we are  considering is understood we shall occasionally denote $f|_A$ again simply as $f$ even though these are formally different functions (their domains are different).

If $A \subset B$ and $g: A \to C$ and there is a function $f: B \to C$ such that $f|_A = g$, we shall say $f$ is an extension of $g$ to $B$ (such a map $f$ need not exist nor be unique).

Let $A$ be a nonempty set.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] A binary relation on a set $A$ is a subset $R$ of $A \times A$ and we write $a \sim b$ if $(a, b)\in R$.
\item[(2)] The relation $\sim$ on $A$ is said to be: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] reflexive if $a \sim a$, for all $a \in A$,
\item[(b)] symmetric if $a \sim b$ implies $b \sim a$ for all $a, b \in A$,
\item[(c)] transitive if $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c$ implies $a \sim c$ for all $a,b,c \in A$.
\end{enumerate}
A relation is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.

\item[(3)] If $\sim$ defined an equivalence relation on $A$, then the equivalence class of $a \in A$ is defined to be $\{x \in A| x \sim a\}$. Elements of the equivalence class of $a$ are said to be equivalent to $a$. If $C$ is an equivalence class, any element of $C$ is called a representative of the class $C$.

\item[(4)] A partition of $A$ is any collection $\{A_i|i\in I\}$ of nonempty subsets of $A$ ($I$ some indexing set) such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] $A = \cup_{i \in I}{A_i}$, and
\item[(b)] $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$, for all $i, j \in I$ with $i \neq j$.
\end{enumerate}
i.e. $A$ is the disjoint union of the sets in the partition.
\end{enumerate}

The notions of an equivalence relation on $A$ and a partition of $A$ are the same:

\begin{proposition}{}{prop0000102}
Let $A$ be an nonempty set.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)]  If $\sim$ defines an equivalece relation on $A$ then the set of equivalence classes of $\sim$ form a partition of $A$.
\item[(2)] If $\{A_i | i \in I\}$ is a partition of $A$ then there is an eqivalence relation on $A$ whose equivalence classes are precisely the sets $A_i$, $i \in I$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Omitted.
\end{proof}

Finally, we shall assume the reader is familiar with proofs by induction.

In Exercises 1 to 4 let $\mathcal{A}$ be the set of $2 \times 2$ matrices with real numbers entries. Recall that matrix multiplication is defined by
\[
\begin{pmatrix}a & b\\ c & d\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}p & q\\r & s\end{pmatrix}=
\begin{pmatrix}ap+br & aq + bs\\cp+dr& cq + ds\end{pmatrix}
\]
Let
\[
M = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\0 & 1\end{pmatrix}
\]
and let 
\[
\mathcal{B} = \{X \in \mathcal{A} | MX = XM\}.
\]

\begin{problemset}
\item Determine which of the following elements of $\mathcal{A}$ lie in $\mathcal{B}$:
\begin{gather*}
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1\\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1\\
1 & 1
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0\\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0\\
0 & 1
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1\\
1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{gather*}

\item Prove that if $P, Q \in \mathcal{B}$, then $P+Q\in \mathcal{B}$ (where $+$ denotes the usual sum of two matrices).

\item Prove that if $P, Q \in \mathcal{B}$, then $P\cdot Q \in \mathcal{B}$ (where $\cdot$ denotes the usual product of two matrices).

\item Find conditions on $p, q, r, s$ which determine precisely when $\begin{pmatrix}p & q \\r & s\end{pmatrix} \in \mathcal{B}$.

\item Determine whether the following functions $f$ are well defined:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] $f:\mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Z}$ defined by $f(a/b) = a$.
\item[(b)] $f:\mathbb{Q} \to \mathbb{Q}$ defined by $f(a/b) = a^2/b^2$.
\end{enumerate}

\item Determine whether the function $f:\real^+ \to \mathbb{Z}$ defined by mapping a real number $r$ to the first digit to the right of the decimal point in a decimal expansion of $r$ is well defined.

\item Let $f: A \to B$ be a surjective map of sets. Prove that the relation
\[
a \sim b \text{ if and only if } f(a) = f(b)
\]
is an equivalence relation whose equivalence classes are the fibers of $f$.

\end{problemset}



\section{Properties of the integers}\label{section00002}
The following properties of the integers $\mathbb{Z}$ (many familiar from elementary arithmetic) will be proved in a more general context in the ring theory of Chapter \ref{chapter008}, but it will be necessary to use them in Part I (of course, none of the ring theory proofs of these properties will rely on the group theory).

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(1)] (Well Ordering of $\mathbb{Z}$) If $A$ is any nonempty subset of $\mathbb{Z}^+$, there is some element $m \in A$ such that $m \le a$, for all $a \in A$ ($m$ is called a minimal element of $A$).

\item[(2)] If $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $a \neq 0$, we say $a$ divides $b$ if there is an element $c \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $b=ac$. In this case we write $a \mid b$; if $a$ does not divide $b$ we write $a \nmid b$.

\item[(3)] If $a, b \in \mathbb{Z} - \{0\}$, there is a unique positive integer $d$, called the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ (or g.c.d.  of $a$ and $b$), satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] $d \mid a$ and $d \mid b$ (so $d$ is a common divisor of $a$ and $b$), and
\item[(b)] if $e \mid a$ and $e \mid b$, then $e \mid d$ (so $d$ is the greatest such divisor).
\end{enumerate}
The g.c.d. of $a$ and $b$ will be denoted by $(a, b)$. If $(a, b) = 1$, we say that $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime.

\item[(4)] If $a, b \in \mathbb{Z} - \{0\}$, there is q unique positive integer $l$, called least common multiple of $a$ and $b$ (or l.e.m. of $a$ and $b$), satisfying:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] $a \mid l$ and $b \mid l$ (so $l$ is a common multiple of $a$ and $b$), and
\item[(b)] if $a \mid m$ and $b \mid m$, then $l \mid m$ (so $l$ is the least such multiple).
\end{enumerate}
The connection between the greatest common divisor $d$ and the least common multiple $l$ of two integers $a$ and $b$ is given by $dl=ab$.

\item[(5)] The Division Algorithm: if $a, b \in \mathbb{Z} -\{0\}$, then there exist unique $q, r\in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
\[
a = qb + r \quad \text{and} \quad 0 \le r < |b|,
\]
where $q$ is the quotient and $r$ the remainder, This is the usual "long division" familiar from elementary arithmetic.

\item[(6)] The Euclidean Algorithm is an important procedure which produces a greatest common divisor of two integers $a$ and $b$ by iterating the Division Algorithm: if $a, b \in \mathbb{Z} - \{0\}$, then we obtain a sequence of quotients and remainders
\begin{gather}
a = q_0b + r_0 \tag{0}\\
b = q_1r_0 + r_1 \tag{1}\\
r_0 = q_2r_1 + r_2 \tag{2}\\
r_1 = q_3r_2 + r_3 \tag{3}\\
\vdots \notag\\
r_{n-2} = q_nr_{n-1} + r_n \tag{n}\\
r_{n-1} = q_{n+1}r_n \tag{n+1}
\end{gather}
where $r_n$ is the last nonzero remainder. Such an $r_n$ exists since $|b| > |r_0| > |r_1| > \cdots > |r_n|$ is a decreasing sequence of strictly positive integers if the remainders are nonzero and such a sequence cannot continue indefinitely. Then $r_n$ is the g.c.d. (a, b) of $a$ and $b$.

\begin{example}
Suppose $a = 57970$ and $b=10353$. Then applying the Euclidean Algorithm we obtain:
\[
\begin{aligned}
57970 &= (5)10353 + 6205\\
10353 &= (1)6205 + 4148\\
6205 &= (1)4148 + 2057\\
4148 &= (2)2057 + 34\\
2057 &= (60)34 + 17\\
34 &= (2)17
\end{aligned}
\]
which shows that $(57970, 10353) = 17$.
\end{example}

\item[(7)] One consequence of the Euclidean Algorithm which we shall use regularly is the following: if $a, b, \in \mathbb{Z} - \{0\}$, then there exist $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that
\[
(a, b) = ax + by
\]
that is, the g.c.d. of $a$ and $b$ is a $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of $a$ and $b$. This follows by recursively writing the element $r_n$ in the Euclidean Algorithm in terms of the previous remainders (namely, use equation (n) above to solve for $r_n = r_{n-2} - q_nr_{n-1}$ in terms of the remainders $r_{n-1}$ and $r_{n-2}$, then use equation (n-1) to write $r_n$ in terms of the remainders $r_{n-2}$ and $r_{n-3}$, etc. eventually writing $r_n$ in terms of $a$ and $b$).

\begin{example}
Suppose $a = 57970$ and $b=10353$, whose greatest common divisor we computed above to be 17. From the fifth equation (the next to last equation) in the Euclidean Algorithm applied to these two integers we solve for their greatest common divisor: $17 = 2057 - (60)34$. The fourth equation then shows that $34 = 4148 - (2)2057$, so substituting this expression for the previous remainder 34 gives the equation $17 = 2057 - (60)[4148 - (2)2057]$, i.e. $17 = (121)2057 - (60)4148$. Solving the third equation for 2057 and substituting gives $17 = (121)[6205 - (1)4148] - (60)4148 = (121)6205 - (181)4148$. Using the second equation to solve for 4148 and then the first equation to solve for 6205 we finally obtain
\[
17 = (302)57970 - (1691)10353
\]
as can easily be checked directly. Hence the equation $ax + by = (a, b)$ for the geatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ in this example has the solution $x = 302$ and $y=-1691$. Note that it is relatively unlikely that this relation would have been found simply by guessing.
\end{example}

The integers $x$ and $y$ in (7) above are not unique. In the example with $a = 57970$ and $b = 10353$ we determined one solution to be $x = 302$ and $y = -1691$, for instance, and it is relatively simple to check that $x = -307$ and $y = 1719$ also satisfy $57970x + 10353y=17$. The general solution for $x$ and $y$ is known (cf. the exercises below and in Chapter \ref{chapter008}).

\item[(8)] An element $p$ of $\mathbb{Z}^+$ is called a prime if $p > 1$ and the only positive divisors of $p$ are 1 and $p$ (initially, the word prime will refer only to positive integers). An integer $n > 1$ which is not prime is called composite. For example, $2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19, \cdots$ are primes and $4,6,8,9,12,14,15,16,18, \cdots$ are composite.

An important property of primes (which in fact can be used to define the primes (cf. Exercise 3)) is the following: if $p$ is a prime and $p \mid ab$, for some $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$, then either $p \mid a$ or $p \mid b$.

\item[(9)] The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says:
